# shared/ Overview

This directory contains cross-repo documents used by the team: plans, assignments, policies, and conventions.

## Contents

- DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md — project phases and milestones
- ASSIGNMENTS.md — roles, RACI, SLAs
- STYLE.md — style rules for shared/ docs (frontmatter, IDs)

## Conventions

- Each file includes YAML frontmatter per STYLE.md
- IDs are kebab-case and versioned when needed (e.g., -v0-1)
- Keep prose concise and actionable; match repository tone
